Free WooCommerce plugin transforms a stock Storefront shop into an eCommerce site with premium features like Facebook/Instagram integration and more.

== Description ==
Shop UX Toolkit is a free, lightweight WooCommerce plugin that upgrades your stock Storefront theme and WooCommerce install into a polished, functional eCommerce site. Toggle features to add premium enhancements like Facebook and Instagram shop integration for seamless social media checkouts and selling, engaging hover effects on product and category boxes to boost user interaction, custom product category ordering to prioritize displays on shop pages and drive sales, keyboard-only focus outlines to hide unsightly borders for mouse users while improving accessibility and SEO, blog post excerpts with "Continue Reading" buttons (replacing full posts on Storefront archives for better engagement), a dedicated customer reviews and testimonials page with submission forms and shortcodes to build trust, and tweaks like preventing empty paginated shop pages and centering modal image titles.

Optimized for Storefront, many WooCommerce-exclusive features (e.g., link styling, hover effects, keyboard focus, Facebook integration, reviews, and category ordering) work with other themes via standard WooCommerce classes—conflicts are unlikely unless the theme/plugin duplicates functionality. Fully tested only on Storefront; test and disable if issues.

Why it's great: Free premium features, stable and supported, minimal performance impact (mostly CSS-based), customizable via settings, modular (use only what you need), enhances SEO/accessibility/user engagement. Turns vanilla WooCommerce into pro-level eCommerce without bloat. [GitHub](https://github.com/SmokingBlends/Shop-UX-Toolkit)

Other benefits: quick setup, no dependencies, improves site speed scores, and encourages customer feedback.

= Features =

- **Link Styling**: Underlines links in shop/category descriptions to match the rest of the site and fixes Google PageSpeed Insights' "links rely on color" error, improving accessibility score and potential SEO. [Live Demo](https://www.smokingblends.com/shop/)
- **Facebook & Instagram Shop Integration**: WooCommerce integration for Facebook & Instagram shopping carts and product catalogs; simply add an auto-created secure cart page in Meta Commerce Manager. [Live Demo](https://www.facebook.com/SmokingBlends/) (view via Facebook mobile app)
- **Product & Category Hover Effects**: Boost WooCommerce shop engagement with eye-catching soft shadows on hover—signals "click me!" to drive more interactions, longer dwell times, and potential SEO gains from better user metrics. [Live Demo](https://www.smokingblends.com/shop/resin-incense/)
- **Category Thumbnails Ordering**: Manually sort the category thumbnails (lower numbers first) on WooCommerce shop pages to boost sales by featuring top categories first. [Live Demo](https://www.smokingblends.com/)
- **Remove Blue Box Around Clickable Elements**: Hides ugly blue focus outlines (that misalign on resize, e.g., site logo) for mouse/touch clicks—standard on Shopify sites; shows only for keyboard navigation (Tab key) to meet accessibility standards. [Live Demo](https://www.smokingblends.com/shop/) (navigate with the mouse and the Tab key to demo)
- **Blog Post Excerpts (Storefront)**: Replace full posts with engaging snippets and "Continue Reading" buttons on archives—boosts readability and click-throughs; standard in premium themes. [Live Demo](https://www.smokingblends.com/blog/)
- **Customer Reviews & Testimonials**: Boost your site's trust and sales by highlighting up to 10 top reviews/testimonials on an auto-generated reviews page that provides your customers with the ability to leave reviews for all the products they ordered on one page. [Live Demo](https://www.smokingblends.com/reviews/)
- **Other WooCommerce Tweaks**: Prevents empty paginated shop pages (sets 404 for non-existent), improving UX/SEO; centers modal image titles for cleaner product views; get fast WooCommerce performance without bloat.
